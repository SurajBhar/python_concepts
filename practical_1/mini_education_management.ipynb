    "## How the Program Works:\n",
    "- Students are added to the system using the `add_student()` function.\n",
    "- Grades are assigned using the `assign_grade()` function.\n",
    "- Attendance is marked by the `mark_attendance()` function, which updates the attendance set.\n",
    "- Basic arithmetic and comparisons are performed to demonstrate how operators work.\n",
    "- The program calculates the average grade of all students and displays their attendance status.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Use in Real Software Industries:\n",
    "In real-world software systems (e.g., education management systems), similar structures could be used to manage students, grades, attendance, and other data. The use of lists, dictionaries, and sets helps organize data efficiently, while loops and functions allow the system to perform repetitive tasks with minimal code duplication.\n"
