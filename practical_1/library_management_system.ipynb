    "1. **Book Management**:\n",
    "   - Add, remove, and search for books in the library.\n",
    "2. **Member Management**:\n",
    "   - Add members, assign books, and track borrowed books.\n",
    "3. **Admin and User Roles**:\n",
    "   - Use inheritance to differentiate between admin and user functionalities.\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "   - Overload methods for searching books by title or author."

    "## Concepts Covered: \n",
    "- Encapsulation: Book, Member, Library and Admin classes encapsulate related data and functionality.\n",
    "- Inheritance: Admin inherits from Member and has additional privileges (add_book , remove_book).\n",
    "- Polymorphism: search_books method allows searching books by title or author dynamically.\n",
    "- Abstraction : Hides complexity, users only interact with high-level classes like Library or Member."
