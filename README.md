# Python Concepts Repository

Welcome to the **Python Concepts** repository! This project is a personal collection of Python programming concepts, where I explore and document various important features of Python. The repository is a work in progress, and I will be updating it regularly as I cover more topics.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Learn the fundamental principles of OOP in Python, including classes, objects, and key concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## File Handling

Examples of how to work with files in Python: reading from, writing to, and managing files efficiently.

## Functions

Understand how to define and use functions in Python, including different types of functions such as lambda functions, decorators, and more.

## Inheritance

Explore inheritance in Python, allowing classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.

## Polymorphism

Learn how polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through shared methods.

## Encapsulation

Understand how to restrict access to methods and variables, and how to hide the internal state of an object in Python.

## Abstraction

A guide to using abstract classes and methods to define blueprints for other classes.

## Magic Methods

Discover Python's "magic methods" (also known as dunder methods), such as `__init__`, `__str__`, and how to customize class behavior.

## Custom Exceptions

Learn how to create your own exceptions for more readable and maintainable error handling in Python programs.

## Operator Overloading

See how to override the behavior of Python operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) for your custom objects.

## Iterators

Learn how to create your own iterable objects using the iterator protocol with `__iter__` and `__next__`.

## Generators

Understand generators in Python for memory-efficient iteration and how to use the `yield` keyword.

## Logging with Multiple Loggers

Implement logging in Python using multiple loggers to keep track of different parts of your codebase effectively.
